- 👋 Hi, I’m @victorKariuki

- I'm a software developer with a passion for building applications that are not only functional but also easy to use. I have a strong background in web development and am always looking for ways to improve my skills.

- 👀 I’m interested in a wide range of technologies, but some of my favorites include:
  JavaScript and its frameworks (such as React and Angular)
  Python and its frameworks (such as Django and Flask)
  Cloud computing platforms (such as AWS and Azure)
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning and data science. I'm particularly interested in using these technologies to build intelligent applications that can make better decisions based on data.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new and interesting projects to work on. Some areas I'm particularly interested in collaborating on include:
  Building web applications with modern technologies
  Developing machine learning models for real-world applications
  Working on open source projects to give back to the community
